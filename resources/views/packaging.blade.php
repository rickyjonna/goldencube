                            Full Packaging is the method used for packing your coconut charcoal briquettes in an inner
                            plastic,
                            then in an inner box,
                            and finally in a master box.

                            this type of packaging is a great fit for retail sales and individual customers who value
                            product
                            presentation. On the other hand, if your primary customers are establishments like bars,
                            lounges,
                            and hookah restaurants, where brand visibility is less important, bulk packaging is the
                            recommended
                            choice.

                            Basically, it is similar to complete packaging but without the inner box. This method
                            significantly
                            reduces costs, saving about 100 USD per ton. It is an ideal and secure option for wholesale
                            hookah
                            coal distributors. This cost-effective packaging solution is particularly suitable for bars and
                            restaurants, as it eliminates unnecessary expenses related to box branding. Additionally, due to
                            the
                            smaller package size, you can load approximately 600 kg more into a container.
