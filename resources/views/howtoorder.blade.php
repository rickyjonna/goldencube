                    To place an order for coconut charcoal briquettes is very simple.

                    1. First of all, you have to choose the shape, size, and specification for coconut charcoal. We are
                    manufacturing shapes of cubes, flats, pipes, fingers, rounds, pillows, and hexagonal. Size may vary from
                    18 to 50 mm. It is better to choose charcoal shapes according to the customer's request.

                <h6 class="warnaputih1">
                    2. The second step is to choose your specification.The main parameter to choose is ash content - how
                    much ash is left after charcoal briquettes are burned down. Less ash is better. We are manufacturing
                    briquettes with ash content of 1.8 - 2.2% for Shisha, and 4 - 6% for BBQ use
                </h6>
                <h6 class="warnaputih1">3. The third step is to choose your packaging.There are a lot of variants to choose
                    from. The basic
                    is
                    an inner box (brand box) of 1 to 5 kg packed inside the master box (10 or 20 kg).The inner box can
                    be
                    made with laminating (glossy or doff), with embossing or gold/silver plating. Mostly inner box is
                    made
                    in full color. The master box can be done in full color or black and white only. It is recommended
                    to
                    use a double wall. It is slightly more expensive than a single wall but makes a box much stronger.

                    4. Forth step is to confirm your payment details and manufacturing schedule.
                </h6>
                <h5 class="warnaputih1 mt-5">Keep in mind that production can take up to 2 weeks. Plus we need time of 3 days
                    to
                    pack and staff the container.</h5>
